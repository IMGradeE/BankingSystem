# stunning-telegram is a mock banking system project.
I started the project during the fall 2024 semester at weber state using node.js, express, and EJS for the individual work portion of software engineering 2, occupying roughly 3 weeks of the course before the group section begins.

Initial Requirements as stated by the professor:
"Over the next three modules, create a banking system which adds the the following features:

1. Login system
- Multiple bank accounts
- Add two bank accounts per account (savings, checking)
- Allow money to transfer between bank accounts, including memo
- Show summary of all transfer transactions with timestamps and memos
3. Add the ability to have account admins and customers accounts.
4. Account admins have access to viewing all accounts changing passwords but canâ€™t view finances.
- Employees have access to all finances but not changing passwords.
- Customers have access to their own account."
